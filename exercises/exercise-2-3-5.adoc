== Introduction

The following admonitions apply to to the entire standard.

Before you make any changes to your configuration, always make sure you have a backup of your system. Configuration errors can result in data loss.

A WPS server can change its offering at any time, in particular between a GetCapabilities, a subsequent DescribeProcess, and a subsequent Execute request.
Any quality of service (QoS) guarantees are within the responsibilities of the service provider and not covered by this standard.
